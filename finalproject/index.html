                        <p>
                            Worked at Odawa Casino for almost 3 years as a dealer both full time and part time.
                            <br>I was taught how to deal Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, 3 Card Poker, Let It Ride, Ultimate Texas Hold'em
                            and dealt them all proficiently.
                            <br>This was my first main job after graduating high school besides side jobs at various restaurants.
                            <br>The staff at Odawa thought highly of customer service and I was taught how to improve my interaction with guests
                            and how to quickly and efficiently diffuse tense situations with guests. 
                        </p>

                            Since moving to TCC in March, I have learned how to deal Poker (Texas Hold'em, Omaha), Mississippi Stud, and Crazy 4 Poker.
                            <br>I dealt at TCC for about 6 months before I got promoted to Pit Supervisor.
                            <br>As a Pit Supervisor I learned how to tactfully deal with issues that arose with dealers; I also learned how to make schedules
                            and use Microsoft Excel and Sharepoint proficiently. I've worked with player tracking software such as Bally and Konami Synkros and 
                            how to handle large cash in/chips out transactions.

                    <p>
                        In fall of 2018 I decided that the casino life just wasn't for me and I had no future plans to Pit Boss for the rest of my life. I started
                        going to NMC full time to pursue a degree in Computer Information Systems. I quickly realized I had other passions and skills beyond the 
                        gaming industry.
                        <br>As of this website I am proficient in HTML and CSS3, MSSQL, and C#. I have plans to get my bachelors degree at Ferris State and if at all 
                        possible to continue on to my Master's degree at Grand Valley State University.
